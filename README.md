## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I do reverse engineering (not really) and stuff, find my write ups [here](https://brew.is-not-a.dev/). I have played with WWU, \[:\], reCAPTCHA the Flag, Cosmic Bit Flip, and L3ak. Notable things:
- 2nd in PlaidCTF
- 7th in PicoCTF high school div
- A bunch of other <10 places in random CTFs (squ1rrel (twice), Cyber Apocalypse, tuctf, knightctf, bronco, etc)
