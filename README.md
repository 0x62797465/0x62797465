## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I do reverse engineering (not really) and stuff, find my write ups [here](https://brew.is-not-a.dev/). I have played with \[:\] (aka slices), reCAPTCHA the Flag, Cosmic Bit Flip, and L3ak. Notable things:
- 1st HITCON (with slices)
- 2nd in PlaidCTF (with slices)
- 7th in PicoCTF high school div (with reCAPTCHA the Flag)
- A bunch of other <10 places in random CTFs (squ1rrel (twice), Cyber Apocalypse, GoogleCTF (quals), bcactf, tuctf, knightctf, bronco, etc)
